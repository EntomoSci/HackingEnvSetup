# HackingEnvSetup
Collection of scripts for the setup of my hacking environment.

## Usage

Download the setup script from the raw version of the file:
   ```sh
   curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/typ1st/HackingEnvSetup/main/Setup.sh
   ```
Change its permissions and make the script executable:
```sh
chmod 744 ./Setup.sh
```
Run the script with `source` to get the changes immediately available in your current shell session:
```sh
source ./Setup.sh
```
